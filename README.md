# NW_AFK_Harvest

Another basic tool i've used for NW
Uses OpenCV to find the E picture on screen to harvest things
The anti afk just jumps instead of moving you around so to not mess up the range of pressing E

I'm sure there are bugs and plenty of room for improvment, feel free to msg me with any suggestions etc. on Discord
